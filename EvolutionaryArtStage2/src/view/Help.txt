1. Starting the Evolution Process.
============================================================================================
Click on the 'New Biomorph' button on the home screen. Select the amount of lines you want your biomorph to
have; click 'generate' until you find the biomorph of your choice. After finding the right biomorph
click the 'next' button to continue to the next screen and start mutating your biomorph.

2. Mutating and Mating Biomorphs.
============================================================================================
To mutate, click on one of the biomorphs in the 'children' section. After selecting the biomorph of your 
choice click on the mutate button. This will mutate the selected child with the parent to produce a new
parent biomorph.

To mate, click on two of the biomorphs in the 'children' section and then select mutate. This will mate
the two selected children biomorphs and the result will replace the current parent.

If at any point you wish to go back to a previously generated biomorph, click the 'undo' button.

that appears. This would add the artwork to the parent panel, where you can continue with the mutation process.

To remove a biomorph from the hall of fame, simply click on the biomorph and click on the remove button that
